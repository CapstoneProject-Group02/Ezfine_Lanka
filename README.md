# Online Fine Payment System

This repository contains an online fine payment system consisting of a client-side frontend built with React.js and a server-side backend developed using Node.js and Express.js. The project uses a MySQL database for data storage.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MySQL

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- MySQL installed (you can use XAMPP for easy setup).

### Setting Up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the `client` folder: `cd client`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the frontend development server: `npm start`

### Setting Up the Backend
1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `server` folder: `cd server`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the backend server: `npm start`

### Setting Up the Database
1. Start the XAMPP server to run MySQL.
2. Create a new MySQL database and tables as needed for your application.

## Usage
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, you can access the application through your web browser. 
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or whichever port your backend is configured to run on)
